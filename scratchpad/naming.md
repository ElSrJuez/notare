## 🎨 Design Language & Logo Direction

### 🔍 Visual Metaphors
- **Marking/Highlighting** → underline, dots, strokes, checkmarks.  
- **Observation** → magnifying glass, lens, prism.  
- **Structure/Order** → outline bullets, stacked rectangles, slides.  

### 🔷 Shapes & Motifs
- Rounded geometric forms (**trust, friendliness**).  
- Circle/oval lens for the **magnifying aspect**.  
- Horizontal strokes or lines suggesting **annotation/highlighting**.  
- Minimalist serif or modern sans-serif with **classical influence**.  

### ✒️ Typography
- Use the **macron in Notāre** as a distinguishing mark:  
  - Styled like a **highlight bar** over the “a.”  
  - The macron itself can double as the **logo motif** (a bar/line = “mark”).  

### 🎨 Colors
- **Primary** → deep navy or charcoal (*intellectual, stable*).  
- **Accent** → bright yellow, lime, or teal (*to symbolize highlighting*).  
- **Secondary** → muted neutrals (*light grey, ivory* for balance).

## 🖼️ Possible Logo Concepts
1. **Wordmark + Bar** → “Notāre” in a clean font, with the macron stylized as a highlight bar.  
2. **Lens & Mark** → a circle (magnifying glass) partially overlapping a line of text, with one section highlighted.  
3. **Bullet Outline Motif** → a dot + short line (like a PowerPoint bullet) repeating subtly, integrated with the text.  
4. **Prism Effect** → a beam narrowing into a structured set of lines (raw input → refined outline).
